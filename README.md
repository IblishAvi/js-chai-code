                                            Objects
Object is a very vast topic in Javascript according to me ,it is because it has lot of methods and 
the Features such as Spread operator and Array of object which will further help to learn API handling. 
object destructuring is vast and important Topic in Js.


                                     Execution context.
it is create once the program is start .it has two basic part which  are Memory and Execution context.
 Memory:- As name suggest it stores the value in it and waits for the execution context to work on it.it initially assign undefined to all the variable.
                                 Type of execution context
1.Global Execution Context
